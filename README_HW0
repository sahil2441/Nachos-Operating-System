I made this android app a few months back that tracks user's location and notifies people-friends/family.

So it's like you can create a trip, say Stony Brook to NYC, and add bunch of your friends in the 
list of recipients. So the app will notify your friends when you:
-leave SBU
-reach NYC

-leave NYC
-reach SBU

You can also create up to two checkpoints- say Hunnington.
So whenever you reach/leave those checkpoints the app is gonna notify your pals.
